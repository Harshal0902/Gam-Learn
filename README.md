## Problem Statement
We all know about the impact of COVID-19 and its impacts and we all know that it has presented an unprecedented challenge to the education system.  It is still all-right for the senior students but the junior students are the ones who needs regular interaction  and our current mode of exams is not able to provide this to them.

## Solution Proposed
We have designed an quiz portal which will be in a form of a game, as we all know that games are one of the best way of get interests of students. 

## Solution Overview
- Provide an interactive platform for quiz.
- Conduct exams in form of a game.
- Easy for students to attempt questions.
- Those who win will pass the exam or else fail.
